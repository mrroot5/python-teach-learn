# 0.2_hello-world

The main topic of this branch is to practice with GitHub.

## Create your own branch

```shell
git checkout -b 0.2_hello-world_jhon-doe
```

## Start coding

The objective of this exercise is to print a "Hello {something}" on your terminal.

You must receive an argument and print the word "Hello" with the argument value.
For example:

If the script is executed with the value `Peter` then you should print `Hello Peter`.
It does not matter if the user introduces a string, int, etc, just print it.
