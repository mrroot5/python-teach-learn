The objective of this exercise is to print a "Hello {something}" on your terminal.

You must receive an input from the user and print the word "Hello" with the user input.
For example:

If the user introduces `Peter` then you should print `Hello Peter`.
It does not matter if the user introduces a string, int, etc, just print it.
